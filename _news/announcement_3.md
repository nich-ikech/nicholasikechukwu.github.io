Title:Divergence under Overlap Shifts: Stability–Plasticity Drift in Query-Based VTs for Continual Panoptic Segmentation

---
Abstract:Continual panoptic segmentation is commonly evaluated under a single, fixed task partition, which obscures model behavior under realistic distribution shifts. This talk introduces a family of controlled image–class overlap regimes that systematically vary both sample- and label-level overlap between incremental tasks for query-based vision transformers built on Mask2Former-style architectures. Within this framework, we compare some continual panoptic segmentation methods and show that some exhibit pronounced divergence and stability–plasticity drift under overlap shifts, whereas alternative architectures remain substantially more stable. I will present initial quantitative evidence of this behavior across overlap settings and outline an ongoing component-level analysis aimed at identifying which architectural mechanisms primarily drive overlap sensitivity, with the broader goal of informing more robust continual segmentation designs
