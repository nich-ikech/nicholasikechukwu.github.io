I am a CS PhD student at Boston University, where I have the rare good fortune of being co-advised by Profs. Bryan Plummer and Deepti Ghadiyaram. My research interests sit at the crossroads of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Robotics. This intersection continually shapes both my work and my curiosity. I study query-based vision models and long-term visual perception for autonomous systems, driven by a simple but ambitious question: how can machines learn not just to visually perceive, but to remember, adapt, and act over time? With a background in Computer Engineering and prior industry experience building AI-driven software across diverse applications, I enjoy bringing a practical lens to theoretically grounded research.

As a Teaching Fellow at BU, I also enjoy the rare privilege of talking about what I love, supporting and guiding students through AI, Machine Learning, and Reinforcement Learning while discovering that teaching often reveals insights research alone cannot. 

Outside the lab and classroom, I unwind at the piano, experiment with delightfully unpolished art, explore the city by bike, and find clarity at the gym


<!-- Nicholas Ikechukwu is a CS PhD student at Boston University, where he has the rare good fortune of being co-advised by Profs. Bryan Plummer and Deepti Ghadiyaram. My research interests have placed me squarely at the crossroads of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Robotics. This intersection defines both my research and curiosity. My research involves studing and working with query-based vision models and long-term visual perception for autonomous systems, motivated by a simple but ambitious question: how can machines learn not just to see (perceive), but to remember, adapt, and act over time? With my background in Computer Engineering via a Bachelor in Engineering, and prior industry experience building AI-driven systems across diverse applications, I love to bring a practical lens to theoretically grounded research.

<!-- Nicholas Ikechukwu is a CS PhD student at Boston University, co-advised by Profs. Bryan Plummer and Deepti Ghadiyaram. His research interest lies at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Robotics, with a focus on query-based vision models and long-term vision-based perception for autonomous systems. He holds a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering. Nicholas also serves as a Teaching Fellow at BU, helping in tutoring AI, Machine Learning, and Reinforcement Learning concepts.  Prior to his PhD, Nicholas gained industry experience where he worked on AI-driven software across multiple applications. 

Outside research and coursework, he interests himself with piano, lazy art, biking, and working out at the gym. -->
